# Meat Me At the N00dle Shack!
Meat me at the N00dle Shack!!
a 4.20GB bitburner starting script/mini-game/?challenge?.

Challange:
  -correct a script('upserv.js') to automate the incremental purchase of servers to max ram and deploy hacking script on them before the incrulded broken version freezes the home server.
  (about 45 min.)

Rules:
  -player must buy all home ram upgrades and all darkweb port hacking tools in the order they become financially available.
  -working 'upserv.js'must be included as a file to write from 'MmatNS.js'.
  -completed 'upserv.js' needs to be under 10.20GB.
  
Timeline:
  -player action  -total elasped time;
  
  -purchase Tor - 4 min;
  -buy brute - 9 min;
  -upgrade home ram- 12 min;
  -buy FTPCrack - 17 min;
  -upgrade home ram - 24 min.;
  -buy relaySMTP - 32 min.;
  -upgrade home ram - 40 min.;
  
 from this point, once you earn 11 million$(about 46 min. from start if the upgrades were followed), the script 'upserv.js' will run and either crash the 'home' system, or, if you have resolved the issue, everything will run smoothly through the first set of milestones/augmentations.
  times up!

My solution is file walkthrough.js
